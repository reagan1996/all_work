# Create a class for a Scrabble object
# take in a string
# method for a scrabble object that computes my score
    # initiate a counter to keep score
    # separate letters in string, by interating of the string
        # each letter has a value, so I can test for the value of that letter
        # make an if statement to check each letter
        # check the value of the letter
            # Add to counter
    # return the counter

# Refractoring code
    # to have the if statement / test in separate function
    # consider encapsulation and make it a private method

# have a router (keep allowing inputs, unitl they decide to stop)
    # until input == 'some-word007'
